          Technomantra is an annual technical event celebrated at K S School of
          Business Management, Gujarat University. Since its inception, we have
          been dedicated to providing a platform for students to showcase their
          technical skills and creativity. The event aims to foster innovation,
          collaboration, and learning among the students. We strive to inspire
          young minds to think critically, problem-solve creatively, and excel
          in the field of technology.
